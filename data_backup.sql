They have a pointed snout with pink nose and long dark whiskers and brown eyes.  The large pointed ears are furless on the inside.  Possum fur is fluffy grey or dark brown on the head, back and tail and white or dirty yellow on the belly and there are several colour forms [link to fur].  Mature possums have a brown stain (the sternal gland) between their front legs.  The front legs are shorter than the hind legs.  Front paws are rather hand-like, and rear paws rather longer with a pair of fused digits. Possums are marsupials, so they give birth to very small young that climb into the motherâ€™s pouch.  They stay in the pouch for at least 120 days.','Furry body, long bushy tail, shorter front legs, pair of fused toes on hind feet, protruding brown eyes, pointed snout with pink nose, pointed ears without fur on the inside.','Similar to a cat, Males and females are similar in size; between 650 and 930 mm, including a tail of 250 to 405 mm.  That is about the size of a cat.  Adults weigh between 1. 4 and 6.4 kg.','Droppings (pellets) are long and cigar-shaped or slightly curved, like jellybeans, with slightly pointed ends.  They are called pellets, can be found singly or in groups, and are usually about 15-30 mm long and 5-14 mm wide.  The colour and texture vary with diet, but they are often various shades of green, darkening with age.  Possum pellets can have a distinctive smell rather like pickled onions.  In spring when pine pollen cones are common the pellets can be bright yellow. Can be confused with: Droppings are quite different to deer or goat pellets because of their elongated shape, whereas ungulate pellets are round.. Possum droppings are often found on logs and stumps, while deer and goat droppings are mostly found on the ground and often in pellet heaps. Large weta droppings can sometimes be mistaken for those of juvenile possums.','Five-toed fore-feet, different hind-feet, claw marks.','Possums damage our native forests by browsing on foliage, flowers and fruit, especially of some preferred plant species.

Correct placement of the traps or stations can be important to successfully controlling possums so get advice from DOC or your local council.

The first hares in New Zealand apparently jumped ship from the Eagle in 1851 and swam ashore at Lyttelton. However, that population died out. Most of the hares in New Zealand probably came from England via Phillip Island in Victoria, Australia through successive importations between 1867 and 1871. Hares were protected until about 1870, although legislation in 1866 allowed landowners or tenants to control them.

At slow speeds prints are asymmetrical, unlike those of rabbits where hind feet are side by side.','Hares\' main ecological impact is damage to native vegetation and pasture. They can compete with livestock for food but this is hard to quantify, especially where other herbivores are present, such as rabbits, possums, deer and goats.\r\n\r\nHares can prevent regeneration of native plants in favoured hare habitats in the sub-alpine and alpine zones, and can damage sensitive native vegetation around alpine ponds and wetlands. Hares may also eat the some plant species in restoration areas, especially during the first four to five months following planting. Hares can also show a preference for some plant species which, if nationally threatened species, increases the risk of plant population decline or even extinction.\r\n\r\nIn some instances hares may help to maintain biodiversity of indigenous plants and associated invertebrate species by suppressing introduced weeds and exotic grasses.','Browses on leaves and stems of grasses, tussocks, seedlings and other vegetation up to 1 m height, including bark and branches of woody vegetation.  Leaves can be stripped off completely and stems nipped off at a 45 degree angle.','Night-time spotlight shooting can reduce hare density but animals can become light-shy.
